"Daily Prophet"

This project is based on the weekly objective 06 of the QA Assurance course, where it was required to take a current news item and imitate it in an html format respecting the semantics.
A news story rich in resource was chosen, such as, for example, one that had a title, subtitle, images, links, footer, among others.

To see the chosen news, go to the following link: https://www.lacapital.com.ar/economia/santa-fe-cerro-el-2020-un-superavit-financiero-18-mil-millones-n2646522.html

A fictitious name was chosen for the newspaper, thus also calling its repository on GitHub, which can be found at the following link: https://github.com/narellac/DailyProphet
