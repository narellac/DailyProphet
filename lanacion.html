    <p class="parag">The researchers are surprised. In Mexico they found the <strong>fossil of a shark</strong>, a plankton eater. It was analyzed by an international team of paleontologists led by a scientist from the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), who published their findings in the journal Science.</p>
    <p class="parag">93 million years ago, <strong>strange "winged" sharks swam in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico</strong>. This newly described fossil species, called Aquilolamna milarcae, allowed its discoverers to erect a new family. Like stingrays, these <strong>“eagle sharks” are characterized by extremely long and thin pectoral fins that are reminiscent of wings</strong>. The specimen studied was <strong>1.65 meters long and 1.90 meters wide</strong>.</p>
    <p class="parag">Aquilolamna milarcae had a tail fin with a well-developed upper lobe, typical of most pelagic sharks, such as the whale shark and the tiger shark. Thus, its anatomical characteristics give it a chimerical appearance that combines sharks and rays. <strong>With its large mouth and supposedly very small teeth, it must have fed on plankton</strong>, according to the international research team led by <strong>Romain Vullo</strong>, from the CNRS.</p>
    <p class="parag"><strong>Scientists identified only one category of large plankton</strong> feeders in the Cretaceous seas so far: a group of large bony fish (pachycormidae), which is now extinct. Thanks to this discovery, they now know that a second group, the eagle sharks, was <strong>also present in the Cretaceous oceans</strong>, according to a CNRS statement.</p>
    <p class="parag"><strong>The complete specimen was found in 2012 in Vallecillo</strong> (Mexico), a locality that produces remarkably preserved fossils. This site, already famous for its many fossils of ammonites, bony fish and other marine reptiles, is very useful for documenting the evolution of ocean animals.</p>
    <p class="parag">In addition to shedding light on the structure of Cretaceous marine ecosystems, <strong>the discovery of the eagle sharks reveals a new</strong>, hitherto unsuspected <strong>facet of the evolutionary history of sharks</strong>.</p>
