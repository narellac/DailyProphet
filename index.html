            <p> The accounts of the Santa Fe state closed with a positive financial result of $ 18,051 million in 2020, according to the report on provincial finances published yesterday by the Ministry of Economy.

                The surplus results from subtracting the accumulated resources of $ 416,241 million during last year, total expenses of $ 398,189 million. The economic result, which arises from the comparison between current income and expenses, showed savings of $ 35,967 million.
                
                Current resources, derived mainly from national and provincial tax collection, totaled $ 412,275 million last year, 38% more than in the previous year. Capital amounts totaled $ 3,965 million, with a year-on-year increase of 5%.
                
                Total expenses executed during 2020 rose 25%, a negative evolution in relation to inflation. Capital expenditures were nominally reduced compared to last year by 34%, from $ 33,363 million to $ 21,881 million. In the construction sub-item, spending fell almost by half, from $ 22,833 million to $ 10,633 million.
                
                Current expenses rose 32% compared to 2019, which marks a reduction in real terms. Within this category, the disbursements in salaries rose slightly more than 26% nominal.
                
                Current transfers by co-participation to municipalities and communes went from $ 24,482 million in 2019 to $ 33,678 million in 2020.
                
                Last year a little more than $ 5 billion was allocated to service the public debt.</p>
